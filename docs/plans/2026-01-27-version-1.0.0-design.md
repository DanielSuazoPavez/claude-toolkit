# Version 1.0.0 Design

## Summary

**1.0.0 = "Polished for Personal Use"**

A stable, honest representation of the toolkit's current state with accurate status labels, tested core resources, and automated hook testing.

## Goals

1. **Status hygiene** - All resources have accurate, meaningful status
2. **Core stability** - Resources actually used are `stable` or `beta`
3. **No dead weight** - Untested `new` resources either tested or removed
4. **Automated hook testing** - Extract existing test cases into runnable script
5. **Known issues documented** - Pain points acknowledged in docs

## Non-Goals (Deferred to 2.0+)

- Hook UX noise fix (Claude Code limitation - "running 5 hooks" on every Bash)
- Shared vs this-project resource separation
- Public-ready onboarding and documentation
- New resources from backlog

## Status Vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `stable` | Battle-tested, works reliably |
| `beta` | Works, minor known issues |
| `alpha` | Works in testing, limited real-world use |
| `new` | Just added, untested |

## Deliverables

### 1. Apply Status Updates from Audit

| Resource | Current | New Status |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `setup-worktree` | new | alpha |
| `design-tests` | new | alpha |
| `codebase-mapper` | new | alpha |
| `implementation-checker` | new | stable |
| `secrets-guard.sh` | beta | alpha |
| `enforce-make-commands.sh` | beta | alpha |
| `copy-plan-to-project.sh` | beta | stable |
| `enforce-uv-run.sh` | beta | alpha |
| `suggest-json-reader.sh` | beta | alpha |
| `block-dangerous-commands.sh` | beta | alpha |
| `relevant-conventions-backlog_schema` | new | stable |

### 2. Test Remaining `new` Skills

Skills to test and decide (keep/prune/improve):

**Code Quality:**
- `review-plan`
- `review-changes`
- `analyze-naming`
- `design-qa`

**Design & Architecture:**
- `design-db`
- `design-diagram`

**Development Tools:**
- `teardown-worktree`
- `read-json`
- `design-docker`

**Decision criteria:**
- Works as documented → promote to alpha
- Works but needs improvement → note issues, keep as alpha
- Broken or doesn't fit → remove or move to backlog

### 3. Extract Hook Tests into Automated Script

Each hook file contains test documentation. Create `scripts/test-hooks.sh` that:
- Runs documented test cases for each hook
- Reports pass/fail status
- Can be run manually or in CI

### 4. Update Documentation

- Update index files (SKILLS.md, AGENTS.md, HOOKS.md, MEMORIES.md) with new statuses
- Add status vocabulary definition to README or a memory
- Update VERSION to 1.0.0

### 5. Known Issues Section

Document in README or HOOKS.md:
- Hook matcher limitations cause multiple hooks to fire per Bash call
- `enforce-make-commands.sh` requires project-specific Make target configuration

## Out of Scope Items (Tracked for Later)

| Item | Notes | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| Hook UX noise | Claude Code matcher limitation | 2.0+ or upstream fix |
| Shared vs this-project separation | See design question below | 2.0+ |
| Public onboarding | Need more personal usage first | 2.0 |
| Backlog items (new skills/agents) | P1-P3 in BACKLOG.md | Post-1.0 |

## Open Design Questions (2.0+)

### Internal Toolkit Resources vs Shared Resources

**Problem:** Some resources are for developing the toolkit itself (meta), others are general-purpose (meant to sync to other projects). Currently no distinction.

**Examples of potentially "internal-only":**
- `write-skill`, `write-agent`, `write-hook`, `write-memory` (meta-skills)
- `evaluate-*` skills (toolkit quality checks)
- Toolkit-specific memories

**Examples of "shared":**
- `brainstorm-idea`, `design-db`, `review-changes` (general workflows)
- `block-dangerous-commands.sh`, `secrets-guard.sh` (safety hooks)
- Code style memories

**Options:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Tag & filter** - Add `internal: true` to frontmatter, sync script filters | Single location, flexible | Adds metadata complexity, filtering logic |
| **Separate directories** - `.claude/internal/` vs `.claude/shared/` | Clear separation, simple sync | Painful restructure, breaks existing paths |
| **Separate repo** - Internal stays here, shared becomes `claude-toolkit-core` | Clean boundaries | Two repos to maintain, version coordination |
| **Don't separate** - Ship everything, users delete what they don't need | Simple, no work | Cluttered target projects, confusing for new users |

**Decision criteria:**
- How often do target projects actually not want the "internal" resources?
- Is the sync script smart enough to handle filtering?
- Does public release (2.0) change the calculus?

**Status:** Parked. Gather more experience with syncing to multiple projects before deciding.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All status fields in indexes are accurate
- [ ] No `new` skills remain untested (either promoted or removed)
- [ ] `scripts/test-hooks.sh` exists and passes
- [ ] VERSION file reads `1.0.0`
- [ ] Known issues documented

## Work Sequence

1. Apply status updates (quick, mechanical)
2. Test `new` skills one by one (may span sessions)
3. Create hook test script
4. Final documentation pass
5. Bump version to 1.0.0
