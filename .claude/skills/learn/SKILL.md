# Learn

Capture a lesson from the current session. Lightweight — identify, format, write.

**See also:** `/manage-lessons` (lifecycle: promote, archive, crystallize after capture), `scripts/lessons/db.py` (DB layer and CLI), `session-start.sh` hook (nudges for manage-lessons)

## When to Use

- User explicitly asks to remember/save something
- After a correction that should persist across sessions
- When a project-specific pattern or gotcha is discovered

## When NOT to Use

- Trivial corrections (typos, wrong variable name in a one-off)
- Things already documented in CLAUDE.md or memories
- General knowledge (not project-specific)

## Process

1. **Search** for duplicates — check existing lessons via FTS
2. **Infer** tags and draft one-line lesson text
3. **Present** the proposed lesson (tags + text) — write unless user objects
4. **Write** to lessons.db with full metadata

No evaluation rubrics, no multi-round iteration. Propose → write.

### Duplicate & Recurring Detection

Before writing, search existing lessons:

```bash
uv run scripts/lessons/db.py search "<key phrase from lesson>" --limit 5
```

- If an existing lesson says essentially the same thing → **skip**, tell the user it already exists
- If a similar lesson exists (same topic, different angle) → **write** and add the `recurring` tag

### Tags

Tags replace the old fixed categories. Assign one category-equivalent tag plus any relevant domain tags:

**Category-equivalent tags** (pick one):

| Tag | When to Use |
|-----|-------------|
| `correction` | Claude did something wrong, user corrected it |
| `pattern` | Recurring approach or idiom in this project |
| `convention` | Project-specific naming, structure, or style rule |
| `gotcha` | Non-obvious behavior, surprising edge case, or trap |

**Domain tags** (add as relevant): `git`, `hooks`, `skills`, `memories`, `permissions`, `resources`, `testing`

### Presenting the Proposal

```
Proposed lesson:
- Tags: <category-tag>, <domain-tag1>, <domain-tag2>
- Lesson: <one-line actionable rule>
```

Then write immediately unless the user objects or asks for changes.

### Writing to lessons.db

The `add` subcommand handles ID generation, project/branch detection, and domain tag inference:

```bash
uv run scripts/lessons/db.py add \
  --text "<lesson text>" \
  --tags "<category-tag>,<extra-tag1>,<extra-tag2>"
```

The command auto-detects project name and git branch, generates a unique ID, and infers additional domain tags from the lesson text.

If duplicate detection flagged `recurring`, include it in tags:

```bash
uv run scripts/lessons/db.py add \
  --text "<lesson text>" \
  --tags "<category-tag>,recurring,<extra-tags>"
```

## Quality Heuristic

> Would this help a future session avoid repeating the same mistake? If yes → save. If no → skip.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Lesson inflation | Saving trivial corrections | Only save lessons that apply to future sessions |
| Vague lessons | "Be more careful with imports" | Specific: "Use absolute imports in the `api/` package" |
| Duplicates | Same lesson saved twice | Search existing lessons before proposing |
| Tag confusion | Everything is `correction` | Match category tag to what happened |
