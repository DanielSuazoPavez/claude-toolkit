# Sync Manifest — controls what claude-toolkit sync copies to projects.
#
# Rules:
#   - One entry per line, paths relative to .claude/
#   - Directories end with / — includes all files recursively
#   - Individual files listed by exact path
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - If a path doesn't exist, it's skipped with a warning to stderr
#
# Anything NOT listed here stays in the toolkit only.
# Projects use .claude-toolkit-ignore for per-project exclusions.
